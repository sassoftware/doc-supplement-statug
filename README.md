# SAS/STAT User's Guide: Sample Programs

This repository contains the examples and other supplementary materials for procedures that comprise the SAS/STAT User's Guide.  Sample programs are .sas files, and (most) are named by concatenating a 3-5 character abbreviation of the procedure, a "gs" or "dt" or "ex" depending on if the example is from the Getting Started, Details, or Examples section, and a number.
